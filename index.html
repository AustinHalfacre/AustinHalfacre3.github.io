<h2 class="aboutme">About Me</h2>
  <p>I currently live right off the peaceful shores of Fort Myers Beach, Florida with my three roommates. I'm currently 21 years young and plan on graduating with the 2020 class. I have a beautiful pet turtle named Sheldon who loves to watch me design apps or play around with code.</p>

  <div class="description">Ever since I was two years old, I've been connected to computers one way or another. Sicne childhyood, my dad has taught me the basics of coding and how to make simple applications. I furthered my knowledge by attempting to make a game when I was in highschool and now I'm pursing my BS in Computer Information Systems at Florida Gulf Coast University. Currently a junior, I spend most my time doing school work and working my nomral part time job, but I also try my best to give back when I can. Some things that I do to try to help out are:
