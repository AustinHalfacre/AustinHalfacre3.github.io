<h2 class="aboutme">About Me</h2>
  <p>I currently live right off the peaceful shores of Fort Myers Beach, Florida with my three roommates. I'm currently 21 years young and plan on graduating with the 2020 class. I have a beautiful pet turtle named Sheldon who loves to watch me design apps or play around with code. I also like cats</p>

  <div class="description">Ever since I was two years old, I've been connected to computers one way or another. Sicne childhyood, my dad has taught me the basics of coding and how to make simple applications. I furthered my knowledge by attempting to make a game when I was in highschool and now I'm pursing my BS in Computer Information Systems at Florida Gulf Coast University. Currently a junior, I spend most my time doing school work and working my nomral part time job, but I also try my best to give back when I can. Some things that I do to try to help out are: 
    <ol>
      <li>Volunteering at Animal Clinics</li>      
      <li>Picking up trash at the beach</li>
      <li>Helping get viruses of my parents computer</li>
      <li>Youth group activities at my church</li>
      <li>Rescuing injured animals</li>
      <li>Participate in the Fishing and Wildlife CLubs</li>
    <h3>Education experience</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Into to computer science COP 1500</li>
      <li>Database Concepts & Admin ISM 3212</li>
      <li>Systems Analysis & Design ISM 3113</li>
      <li>Information Systems ISM 3011</li>

    <h4>Field Report</h4>
    <p>Computer science is the study of programming languages, date structures, algorithms and more. The whole idea of computer science is that it’s the nuts and bolts of programming. Software engineering is the art of constructing and designing software systems. This includes the design, implantation, testing and delivery. Information technology is the field of study on management of a data center. Information technologists do programming and work closely with software engineers to make new systems, but they focus mainly on operations and maintenance.
Three fields of computer science that peek my interest are database administrator, information security analyst and computer/information systems manager. A database administrator is supposed to analyze and evaluate the data needs of users. They develop and improve data resources to store and retrieve critical information. They also need exceptionally high problem-solving skill of computer science to correct any malfunctions a database may have. He also modifies the system as the needs of the user evolves overtime. An information security analyst is supposed to create systems to protect information networks and websit3es from cyber-attacks and other security breaches. Some of their responsibilities include researching trends in data security to anticipate problems and install systems to help prevent those issues before they occur. Just like the database administrator, the information security analyst needs very high problem-solving skill of computer science to investigate any breaches that may occur, determine the causes of the breach and how to modify, or fix, the security system. The computer systems analyst is supposed to analyst a company’s technology needs and oversee the implantation of new and appropriate data systems. They also need to be able to evaluate hardware, software, networking, and other technology resources for purchases and or development. Because computer and information systems managers hire, train and supervise staff, the managers must have interpersonal skills. 
The field of compute science that appeals to me the most would be the information security analyst. Being able to protect computer networks at companies and government agencies really peek my interest. The average yearly pay is ninety-five thousand five hundred and ten dollars a year with the hourly pay being around forty-six dollars an hour. An interesting thing to note is that the job outlook is projected to have an increase of twenty eight percent in information security analyst jobs. There are currently around one hundred thousand jobs being fulfilled by people and that proves to show that there are multiple jobs that I could get being an information security analyst
